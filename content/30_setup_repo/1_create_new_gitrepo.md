Each Quick Start consist of a GitHub repo where all the contents of the Quick Start live. This repo is a private GitHub repo during the development phase and made public after launch. 

When you submit a proposal to build a Quick Start, Quick Start team creates a private GitHub repo and give you access to the repo.

For this workshop, you will create a repo in your own github account and use it as a Quick Start repo.
