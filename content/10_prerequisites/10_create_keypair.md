An EC2 KeyPair is required if you want to SSH into an EC2 instance. We will be creating multiple EC2 instances in this workshop and use a KeyPair with those instances.

### Create an Amazon EC2 key pair

Sign-in to your [AWS account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

We will be working in the **eu-central-1** EU (Frankfurt) Region for this workshop, therefore, choose **EU (Frankfurt)** from the upper right of the console.

Go to the **EC2** console by searching or choosing it from the list of AWS services.

Choose **Key Pairs** from the left pane.

Choose **Create Key Pair**. 
![create keypair](/images/create-keypair.png)

Enter the keypair name as **qsworkshop**, and click **create**. This will automatically download a file named **qsworkshop.pem** on your local machine. This is your private key. 

Move **qsworkshop.pem** file to your home directory. The new location should be *~/qsworkshop.pem*.

Run `cd ~` to go to your home directory.

Reduce the permission on your .pem file so only the root user can read it by running `chmod 400 qsworkshop.pem`.
