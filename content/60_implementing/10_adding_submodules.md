The Quick Start catalog has **120+** Quick Starts. It includes a [VPC Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vpc/) which builds a virtual private network (VPC) environment with public and private subnets, following AWS best practices. There is also a [Linux bastion Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/linux-bastion/), which creates a multi-AZ linux bastion environment.

You will use the VPC Quick Start and Linux bastion Quick Start to create VPC and linux bastion environment in your workshop Quick Start. By using these Quick Starts, you get the following benefits:

- Re-use the architeture built by AWS SAs, which follows the AWS best practices.
- Automatically get the AMI and security updates for VPC and Linux bastion stacks.
- Less code to maintain.
- Focus on building the workload.
- Avoid duplicating same code across multiple Quick Starts

### Git Submodules
To use the VPC and Linux bastion Quick Starts in your Quick Start, you will use Git Submodules.

Git Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

We will add two submodules to the **qs-workshop** repo - QuickStart VPC and QuickStart Linux Bastion.

### Add a VPC to your project
Change directory to the root of your repo.

`cd qs-workshop`

Add QuickStart VPC as a submodule.

```
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-aws-vpc.git submodules/quickstart-aws-vpc
```

By running the above command, you have added the **quickstart-aws-vpc** git repo as a submodule in the **submodules/quickstart-aws-vpc** directory of qs-workshop repo, and the submodule is tracking the master branch of the *quickstart-aws-vpc*.

Now, Commit your changes and push to the develop branch.

`git commit -a -m "Add QuickStart VPC Submodule"`

### Add Linux Bastion to your project

Add QuickStart Linux Bastion as a submodule.

```
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-linux-bastion.git submodules/quickstart-linux-bastion
```

By running the above command, you have added the **quickstart-linux-bastion** git repo as a submodule in the **submodules/quickstart-linux-bastion** directory of qs-workshop repo, and the submodule is tracking the master branch of the *quickstart-linux-bastion*.

Commit your changes and push to the develop branch.

`git commit -a -m "Add QuickStart Linux Bastion Submodule"`

{{% notice tip %}}
If you need to update your submodules later you can use the following command  `git submodule update --recursive`
Similarly, if you are cloning an existing repo that already contains a submodule you will need to run `git submodule init` first, then `git submodule update -r` after to copy the contents.

### Verify project structure

Your project directory **qs-workshop** should look like below.

Once you have verified that your project structure is correct, its time to push the changes to the develop branch.

Run `git push origin develop`
