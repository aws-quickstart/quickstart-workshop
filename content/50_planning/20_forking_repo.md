If you are building a new Quick Start, the Quick Start team will have created a repository for you under the aws-quickstart organization. In practice, you would fork this repository to your own account, build the quick start, and submit your work as a pull request. However, for the purposes of this workshop we are using a new repository in your personal GitHub account.
