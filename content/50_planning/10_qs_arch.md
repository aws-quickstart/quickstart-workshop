Quick Starts are built for **production** deployments. Therefore, when designing the architecture of your Quick Start, you should consider answering the following questions, before starting to write the CloudFormation templates.

- **How many Availability Zones the workload will be deployed into?**

	You should use at least two for high availability.

- **Where should your workload be placed?**

	Consider security and external access when deciding whether to install your software in a public or private subnet.

- **How many public and private subnets?**

	If your workload needs an additional level of isolation, you might consider setting up a second private subnet with network ACL protection in each Availability Zone.

- **Is your workload distributed across multiple instances?**

	If yes, use Elastic Load Balancing to help ensure availability and fault tolerance.

- **Is your workload stateless or stateful? Do you save session state in the workload instances?**

	If you donâ€™t, your workload instance would be a good candidate for Auto Scaling.
